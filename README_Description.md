# Repository Description â€” Project Machu Picchu-*Wonderful Life*
(February 2025)

## Root folder
The sources in the root folder include a list of dependencies, a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a TypeScript compiler options configuration file, and a Next.js configuration file.

### Dependencies List:

*   The list in file `package.json` specifies details for various **Node.js modules**, including **versions, resolved locations, integrity checksums, and licenses**.
*   It encompasses modules such as `@babel`, `@emotion`, `@eslint`, `@ethersproject`, `@lit`, `@marsidev/react-turnstile`, `@next`, `@noble/hashes`, `@pinata/sdk`, `axios`, `buffer`, `chalk`, `cookie-es`, `elliptic`, `eslint`, `form-data`, `js-yaml`, `lokijs`, `react`, `uuid`, `viem`, and many others.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration File:

*   There are two Tailwind CSS configuration files.
*   One file is `postcss.config.mjs`, a **configuration object for PostCSS**, which includes **Tailwind CSS** as a plugin.
    *   The `config` object exports a default configuration.
    *   The `plugins` section specifies that **Tailwind CSS** should be used.
*   The other file is `tailwind.config.ts`, it imports the `Config` type from "tailwindcss".
    *   The `content` array specifies the file paths to be scanned for classes.
    *   The `theme` section allows customisation of the default design tokens.
        *   The `extend` section allows extending the default Tailwind theme.
        *   The `colors` section defines the background and foreground colours using CSS variables.
    *   The `plugins` array is empty.

### TypeScript Compiler Options Configuration:

*   This file (`tsconfig.json`) configures the TypeScript compiler.
*   `compilerOptions` specifies various compiler settings:
    *   `lib` includes definitions for the DOM, DOM iterable APIs, and modern ECMAScript features.
    *   `allowJs` allows JavaScript files to be compiled alongside TypeScript files.
    *   `skipLibCheck` skips type checking of declaration files to reduce compilation time.
    *   `strict` enables all strict type checking options.
    *   `noEmit` prevents the compiler from emitting output files.
    *   `esModuleInterop` enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
    *   `module` sets the module system to use (ESNext).
    *   `moduleResolution` specifies how modules are resolved (Bundler).
    *   `resolveJsonModule` allows importing JSON files as modules.
    *   `isolatedModules` ensures that each file can be compiled independently.
    *   `jsx` preserves JSX syntax in the output.
    *   `incremental` enables incremental compilation for faster rebuilds.
    *   `plugins` specifies additional plugins to use during compilation, including the Next.js plugin.
    *   `paths` defines path aliases for simplified module imports.
*   `include` specifies the files to include in the compilation, including TypeScript files, JSX files, and Next.js types.
*   `exclude` specifies the files and directories to exclude from compilation, such as `node_modules`.

### Next.js Configuration File:

*   The file exports a `nextConfig` object.
*   This object is of the type `NextConfig` imported from 'next'.
*   The configuration object is currently empty.

### Note about Next.js
A Next.js application is a React application. Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides additional features and conventions for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static web applications.

In a typical Next.js application, the entry point is not an `index.html` file as you might find in a traditional React application. Instead, Next.js uses a different structure and conventions:

- **Pages Directory**: Next.js uses a **pages** directory to define the routes of your application. Each file in the **pages** directory automatically becomes a route. For example, a file named `index.js` or `index.tsx` in the **pages** directory serves as the entry point for the root URL of the application. 
  
  In this project, there is a `page.tsx` in the **app** folder

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js handles code splitting automatically, so you don't need to manually configure an entry point like `index.html`. Instead, Next.js compiles and serves the necessary JavaScript and HTML for each page.

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js can pre-render pages on the server at request time (SSR) or at build time (static generation). This is handled by Next.js internally, and you don't need to configure an entry point manually.

- **Custom Server**: If you need a custom server or additional server-side logic, you can create a custom server using Node.js. In this case, you would typically create a file like `server.js` and use it to start your Next.js application with additional server-side logic.

In summary, while a traditional React application might use an `index.html` file as the entry point, a Next.js application uses the **pages** directory to define routes and entry points, with Next.js handling the compilation and serving of the application.

## Other folders
In a typical React project, several of these folders are commonly used, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown of what each folder might contain if it is created by React:

- **app**: This folder is often used to store the main **Next.js** application components and logic. It might contain the root component of the application and other high-level components that make up the core structure of the app.

- **components**: This folder is commonly used to store reusable UI components. Each component typically has its own file or subdirectory, making it easier to manage and reuse components across the application.

- **data**: This folder is not specific to React but can be used to store static data files, such as JSON files, that the application might need. It's not typically created by React itself but can be part of a React project structure.

- **hooks**: This folder is used to store custom React hooks. Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Custom hooks allow you to extract and reuse logic across different components.

- **images**: This folder is used to store image assets used in the application. It's not created by React but is a common practice to organize assets in a separate folder.

- **lib**: This folder can be used to store utility functions or libraries that are used across the application. It's not specific to React but can be part of a React project structure.

- **public**: This folder is created by React when you set up a new project using Create React App. It contains static files that are served directly by the web server, such as the `index.html` file and other assets like images or favicons.

- **types**: This folder is used to store TypeScript type definitions if you are using TypeScript in your React project. It helps in organizing type declarations and interfaces.

- **utils**: This folder is used to store utility functions and helpers that are used across the application. It's not specific to React but is a common practice to keep utility code separate from component logic.

In summary, folders like `components`, `hooks`, `public`, and `utils` are commonly used in React projects and serve specific purposes related to organizing components, custom hooks, static files, and utility functions, respectively. The other folders can also be part of a React project but are not specific to React itself.
